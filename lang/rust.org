* Jim Blandy's rust book
** chapter 05: references
 - the == operator always compares values.
 - there's a separate function in std that compares addresses
 - references are never null in rust. instead use Option<T> Some<T> or None.
 - lifetimes: segment of your program in which references are safe to use.
