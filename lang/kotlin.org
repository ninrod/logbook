** local functions
   - basically you can opt for reuse inside a function through declaring a local function
   - the local function has access to outer parameters
** infix functions
   - same as extensions functions, but if an extension function has only one param, you can add "infix" keyword
   - "hello" shouldbeEqualTo var
