The concept is extremely simple: you keep a log of your work, so you
can refer back to it later. Yet, there are relatively few in Computer
Science who does that, which is a sad state of affairs. The odd thing
is that most computer scientists do know the importance of logging in
an application. You see these elaborate logging frameworks that can
log at different log levels, can forward logs between machines and so
on. Yet, it looks like the CS people forgot that the same logging
could apply to your own work.
