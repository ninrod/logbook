* Pacman tricks

- search for a package?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ pacman -Ss $package
#+END_SRC

* create a USB bootable pendrive
** In MacOS

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 # in macos
 diskutil list
 diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX
 # notice the 'r' before 'disk' for raw mode which makes the transfer much faster:
 dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/rdiskX status=progress && sync
 # After completion, macOS may complain that "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer".
 # Select 'Ignore'. The USB device will be bootable.
 #+END_SRC

* use sudo without a password
- from: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=7482

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
#+END_SRC
